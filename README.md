# About ME
Ever since I was a little kid, Computer Science has been my passion. I still remember sitting near my neighbor's computer, watching them Typing Multi color characters in a black screen (later I figured out its a compiler and c++ program). My curiosity to know what it is pushed me into a world of Computers. I started staying in a computer repairing shop after school till night to know more about the Computer, Operating System, Antivirus, and other components. Now my curiosity increased and became my passion which let me take computer sciences in my high school where I learned C++ & OOP's concepts, I Mastered it such a way that I started to compile the program in my mind and predict the output before even my faculty teach 1/4 of it in the presentation.

Finally, I scored 100% mark in Mathematics and 99% in Computer Science and Physic, Now its time to convert passion into life. I taught of pursuing computer science (CS) as my major in college, unfortunately, I lost CS seat for 0.1 cut-off marks and landed into Mechanical Engineer. Hard Time in my life, I had two choices 1. Regrating for not becoming a Software Engineer 2.Believing everything happens for a reason. I took the second step and started focusing on both Computer Science and Mechanical engineering. I started to learn Python myself with my previous knowledge I acquired from My High School but this time in our College Library. Starting from Python to a Machine Learning developer within a year. Soon My Imagination started to expand making Infinite possibilities by combining knowledge on both the fields. I started to participate in Various competitions at both National & International Levels. As a Leader of a Team of 13 (5 Senior,4 co-students, 4 Juniors) from 4 different Departments, we have Won 10 Hackathon, 7 Project Expo, 11 Presentations, 15 Awards, and 2 conferences as of February-2020. My Passion made me a combination of Mechanical Engineer(Department Rank Holder) and Software Developer(Algorithm and Data Structures) making my self a Multi-Disciplinary Engineer. I am happy that the Force that drives me continues in my workplace also. the impact I am going to make in my workplace is the greatest satisfaction I can ever get. Waiting for My Turn
