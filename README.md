# About ME
Ever since I was a little kid, Computer Science has been my passion. I still remember sitting near my neighbor's computer, watching them Typing colorful words in a black screen (later I figured out its a compiler and c program). My curiosity to know what it is pushed me into a world of programming. I started staying in a computer repairing shop after school till night to know more about the computer, operating system, antivirus, and other components. Now my curiosity increased and became my passion which let me take computer sciences in my higher secondary schooling where I leaned C programming, I learned it to the fullest of my heart such a way that I started to compile the program in my mind and predict the output before even my faculty teach 1/4 of it in presentation.

Now its time to convert passion into the life I taught of pursuing computer science as my major in college, unfortunately, we have a plan for our future and God has a better plan than that so I lost computer science engineering seat for 0.25 Cut Off mark landed into Mechanical Engineer Now I had two choices 1. Regrating for not becoming a CS engineer 2.Believing Something God has for me in this field. I took the second step and started focusing on Mechanical engineering learning to the fullest of my heart and topped in my department but yet something inside me Hurts for the 1st reason.

So I taught this illusion should not continue and I started to learn to program myself with my previous knowledge I acquired from My High School. Starting from Python programming to a Machine learning developer within a year. Soon My imagination started to expand making infinite possibilities by combining knowledge on both the departments. I started to participate in Various competitions in both National and International Levels and won in 10 Hackathon, 7 Project Expo, 11 Presentations and 15 Awards, 2 conferences as of February-2020. My Passion made me a combination of Mechanical Engineer(Department Rank Holder) and Software Developer(Python Programmer) making my self capable of work in both the fields. I am happy that the force that drives me continues in my workplace also.
